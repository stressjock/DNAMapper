# 🧬 DNAMapper: Local Autosomal DNA Segment Mapping Tool

A privacy-focused, client-side tool for visualizing and managing shared DNA segments from genetic testing providers.

***

## 🌟 Introduction

DNAMapper is a personal, client-side application designed for mapping and visualizing **autosomal DNA segments**. It was developed as an alternative to existing web-based mapping tools, with a strong focus on **data privacy**. The entire application is contained within a single **HTML file** that runs entirely on your local machine, meaning your sensitive genetic data never needs to be uploaded to an external website or server.

***

## ✨ Key Features

* **Privacy-Focused:** The tool runs 100% locally in your web browser; no data is sent over the internet.
* **Chromosome Visualization:** Displays shared DNA segments chromosome by chromosome (1-22).
* **Match & Group Management:** Allows you to assign matches to custom groups, color-code them, and record ancestor information.
* **Phasing/Status Tracking:** Segments can be designated as **Paternal**, **Maternal**, or **Shared/Unknown**.
* **Pile-Up Detection:** Displays known centromeric or low-recombination regions (Pile-Up areas) for improved analysis of false matches.
* **Project Persistence:** Projects can be saved and loaded locally via JSON files.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use DNAMapper, you only need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).

1.  **Download:** Download the `DNAMapper.html` file and the provided `Example.csv` to your local computer.
2.  **Run:** Open `DNAMapper.html` directly in your web browser.
3.  **Start Project:** Click the **`➕ New Project`** button to initialize the application and set your minimum cM cutoff.
4.  **Add Data:** Click the **`📤 Select & Add Match CSV`** button and select your compatible DNA segment file.

## 📥 Input Data Format

The tool is currently configured to read segment data directly from reports generated by the **MyHeritage Chromosome Browser – Shared DNA Segments** download.

The input CSV file must contain the following nine columns in order to be parsed correctly:

| Header Name | Required Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Name` | Text | Your name (usually duplicated). |
| `Match Name` | Text | The name of your DNA match. |
| `Chromosome` | Integer (1-22) | The chromosome number the segment is located on. |
| `Start Location` | Integer | The starting base pair (BP) location of the segment. |
| `End Location` | Integer | The ending base pair (BP) location of the segment. |
| `Start RSID` | Text/ID | RSID for the start location (used for reference). |
| `End RSID` | Text/ID | RSID for the end location (used for reference). |
| **`Centimorgans`** | Decimal | **Crucial:** The length of the segment in cM. Used to filter segments below your project's minimum threshold. |
| `SNPs` | Integer | The number of SNPs in the segment. |

> **Note on Shared Segments:** As MyHeritage explains: "Shared DNA segments are sections of DNA that you and your DNA Match likely inherited from a common ancestor. If you and multiple DNA Matches all share segments in the same genomic location, that common DNA was likely inherited from a single ancestor and can help you understand how all of you are related."

## 📊 Visualization Output

The tool provides a comprehensive graphical display of your segments, designed to help you triangulate relationships and map your inheritance.

The main visualization area is divided into 22 chromosome tracks. For each chromosome, you can view the segments in two modes:

### 1. Collapsed View (Single Line)
A quick overview showing all segments superimposed on a single line, providing an immediate look at heavy coverage areas.

### 2. Expanded View (Detailed Tracks)
When expanded, each chromosome is broken down into separate tracks:

* **Shared/Both:** Segments that you have not yet identified as Paternal or Maternal. This track also displays **Pile-Up Regions** (hatched gray) where high concentrations of false-positive matches are common.
* **Paternal:** Segments assigned to your father's side of the family.
* **Maternal:** Segments assigned to your mother's side of the family.

By visualizing the segments of your matches chromosome by chromosome, you can better estimate the common ancestral path shared by multiple matches and group them accordingly.

## ⚙️ Development and Customization

Since DNAMapper is a single HTML file, all CSS, HTML, and JavaScript are bundled together, making it easy to customize the look, feel, and functionality of the tool to suit your personal analysis style.
